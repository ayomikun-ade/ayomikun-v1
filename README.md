# Ayomikun: Portfolio

## Overview

This project is a professional engineering portfolio designed to showcase high-performance web applications and visually immersive digital experiences. Built with a "retro-modern" aesthetic, it merges 80s-inspired CRT visuals with cutting-edge React architecture. The site features complex layout animations, a custom interaction system, and a terminal-inspired interface to provide recruiters and clients with a memorable user experience. 💻

## Features

- **Dynamic Boot Sequence**: A custom-built preloader that simulates a kernel initialization sequence, setting the technical tone of the site.
- **Retro CRT Overlay**: An interactive scanline and noise filter system that mimics legacy hardware displays while maintaining modern accessibility.
- **Magnetic Interaction System**: UI components that respond to cursor proximity using vector mathematics for a tactile, premium feel.
- **Project Archive**: A structured repository of work featuring hover-aware gradient tracking and filtered display modes.
- **Responsive Floating Dock**: A persistent navigation system that intelligently hides/shows based on viewport context and section thresholds.
- **System Status Dashboard**: An "About" section designed as a system terminal, providing quick technical metadata about the developer.

## Usage

### Navigating the Interface

The portfolio uses a scroll-linked navigation system. You can use the header links to jump to specific sections or use the **Floating Dock** that appears once you leave the landing area.

### Interacting with Projects

Each project card in the "Projects" section features dynamic lighting. Move your cursor over a card to trigger the radial gradient highlight, which uses Framer Motion to track mouse coordinates in real-time. Click **DEMO** to view the live deployment or **REPO** to inspect the source code.

### Using the Project Archive

For a full list of all engineering experiments, navigate to the `/projects` page. This page uses a responsive grid layout to display the entire project catalog beyond the featured items on the homepage.

### Contact and Networking

The contact section includes a one-tap email copy feature. Clicking the **COPY** button will automatically add the developer's email to your clipboard, confirmed by a UI state change.
